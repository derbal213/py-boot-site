    <h1>Front-end Development is the Worst</h1>
    <p>
      Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who can't handle the real programming.<br />
      I mean, it's just a bunch of divs and spans, right? And css???<br />
      It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaaaat red." What a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real programmers code, not silly markup languages.<br />
      They code on Arch Linux, not macOS, and certainly not Windows.<br />
      They use Vim, not VS Code.<br />
      They use C, not HTML.<br />
      Come to the <a href="https://www.boot.dev">backend</a>, where the real programming happens.
